Below are two proposed improvements addressing your tasks:

## 1. Enhancing Command Handling via Function Calling

**The Problem:**  
Currently, the commands are handled by matching raw text (or even text with extra spaces) against a hard-coded list of aliases. This approach can lead to inconsistent or unstructured data—especially when the user’s message includes extra text or when the command parameters need parsing.

**The Proposed Solution:**  
Leverage the LLM’s new function calling capability to have it “parse” and structure commands. Instead of manually matching a string, you can define a set of functions (each with a JSON schema) that represent the various commands. When a user sends a command (or a message that might be a command), you send along the function definitions in your API call. The LLM will then decide whether to call one of these functions and return a structured JSON payload.

### What This Would Look Like:

1. **Define Function Schemas:**  
   For each command (e.g., `/pong`, `/dark`, `/light`, `/snow`, `/contact`), define a function with a name, description, and a JSON schema for its parameters. For example:

   ```js
   const functions = [
     {
       name: "switchColorMode",
       description: "Switch the UI color mode to dark or light.",
       parameters: {
         type: "object",
         properties: {
           mode: {
             type: "string",
             enum: ["dark", "light"],
             description: "The target color mode.",
           }
         },
         required: ["mode"],
       },
     },
     {
       name: "toggleSnow",
       description: "Toggle the snow effect on the UI.",
       parameters: {
         type: "object",
         properties: {},
       },
     },
     {
       name: "startPongGame",
       description: "Start a game of Pong.",
       parameters: {
         type: "object",
         properties: {},
       },
     },
     {
       name: "prepareContactMessage",
       description: "Structure a contact message.",
       parameters: {
         type: "object",
         properties: {
           name: { type: "string", description: "The sender's name." },
           email: { type: "string", description: "The sender's email address." },
           message: { type: "string", description: "The message body." },
         },
         required: ["email", "message"],
       },
     },
   ];
   ```

2. **Include These in Your Chat API Request:**  
   When sending the chat history (including a new user message) to the OpenAI API, include the `functions` definitions and set a parameter (e.g., `function_call: "auto"`) so that if the LLM identifies a command, it responds with a structured function call.

   ```js
   const stream = await OpenAIStream({
     model: MODELS.GPT_4,
     messages: finalMessages,
     temperature: 0.7,
     functions, // include the definitions
     function_call: "auto",
   });
   ```

3. **Process the Function Call:**  
   In your API route or client-side handler, check if the LLM’s response includes a function call. If so, parse the returned JSON payload and trigger the corresponding action:
   
   - If the function is `switchColorMode`, call your color mode toggler.
   - If it’s `toggleSnow`, dispatch the action to toggle snow.
   - If it’s `prepareContactMessage`, extract and validate the structured data before sending it off to your contact API.

   This approach means that rather than guessing which command was intended based on string matching, the LLM now “decides” by outputting a well-structured function call that you can directly map to an action.

**Benefits:**
- **Structured Data:** The LLM returns commands as JSON—reducing ambiguity and making it easier to validate and act on them.
- **Extensibility:** Adding or modifying commands is as simple as updating the function definitions.
- **Robustness:** Even if users include extra text, the LLM can be guided (via a system prompt) to only return a function call when it detects a clear command intention.

## 2. Fixing Resume Link URLs in Production

**The Problem:**  
In production, the resume links (for both the interactive view and PDF download) are currently generated using the Vercel instance domain (via `process.env.VERCEL_URL`). This can cause issues if external users cannot access the Vercel instance directly or if the domain doesn’t match your public-facing URL.

**The Proposed Solution:**  
Make sure that the base URL always reflects the actual public domain that the user is visiting—even in production. This can be done by:

1. **Using a Public Environment Variable:**  
   Instead of relying on `process.env.VERCEL_URL`, prefer a variable like `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` that you set to your custom domain (e.g., `"https://www.yourdomain.com"`). Update your `getBaseUrl()` helper to check this variable first.

2. **Dynamically Deriving the Base URL in API Routes:**  
   In your server-side code (API routes), inspect the incoming request headers (for example, `x-forwarded-host` and `x-forwarded-proto`) to determine the actual host and protocol that the user is using. For instance:

   ```ts
   export function getBaseUrl(req?: Request): string {
     // If a request is provided (server-side), try to derive the URL from headers:
     if (req) {
       const forwardedProto = req.headers.get('x-forwarded-proto') || 'https';
       const forwardedHost = req.headers.get('x-forwarded-host') || req.headers.get('host');
       if (forwardedHost) {
         return `${forwardedProto}://${forwardedHost}`;
       }
     }
     
     // Otherwise, use the public environment variable if available.
     if (process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL) {
       return process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL;
     }
     
     // Fallback: use Vercel's environment variable (not ideal for public links)
     if (process.env.VERCEL_URL) {
       return `https://${process.env.VERCEL_URL}`;
     }
     
     // Default to localhost (for development)
     return `http://localhost:${process.env.PORT || 3000}`;
   }
   ```

3. **Ensure All Prompts and API Routes Use This Function:**  
   Wherever you construct resume links (for example, in your base prompt or in the resume API route), make sure you pass in the request object (if available) so that the correct URL is derived. For example, in your resume route:

   ```ts
   export async function GET(req: Request) {
     try {
       const baseUrl = getBaseUrl(req);
       return NextResponse.json({
         message: "View or download Jonathan's resume",
         links: {
           interactive: `${baseUrl}/resume`,
           pdf: `${baseUrl}/jonathan-maddison-resume.pdf`
         }
       });
     } catch (error) {
       // Handle error
     }
   }
   ```

**Benefits:**
- **Correct Public URL:** External users always see links pointing to your actual domain.
- **Flexibility:** You can easily change your public domain by updating `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` rather than re-deploying code that references Vercel’s internal URL.
- **Resilience:** Deriving the URL from the request headers in API routes ensures that even if the app is behind a proxy or CDN, the correct host is used.

By implementing these changes, you can make your command handling more robust and structured (using function calling with the LLM), and ensure that public-facing links—like those for Jonathan’s resume—always point to the correct URL regardless of your deployment environment.
