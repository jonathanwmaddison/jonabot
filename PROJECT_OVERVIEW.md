# JonaBot 🤖

## Skip the Resume, Start a Conversation

Hi! I'm Jonathan, and I've reimagined the portfolio experience. Instead of scrolling through endless pages, simply chat with JonaBot - an AI that knows my journey inside and out. Ask anything about my work, skills, or thoughts on tech. It's like having a coffee chat with me, available 24/7.

## The Story Behind JonaBot 🎯

The idea for JonaBot came from a simple realization: traditional portfolios don't capture the dynamic nature of technical discussions. I wanted to create something that would:

1. Let people learn about my work in a natural, conversational way
2. Demonstrate practical applications of AI technology
3. Showcase my technical skills through a living, breathing project
4. Pioneer new ways of professional networking

This project embodies my belief that technology should make human connections more meaningful, not more distant.
